verl-compatible GSM8K reward function used as
    custom_reward_function.path=verl/utils/reward_score/gsm8k_custom.py

verl expects compute_score(data_source, solution_str, ground_truth, extra_info)
but verl.utils.reward_score.gsm8k.compute_score is (solution_str, ground_truth, method, ...).
This module is a thin adapter that hard-codes method='strict' so the reward
signal cannot be satisfied by random numbers leaking in from prepended trivia
facts (Track B). The model MUST emit "#### N" to earn reward.
